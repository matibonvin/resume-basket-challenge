# Resume Throw Challenge 🎯

A fun interactive game where you review resumes and throw rejected ones into a basket! Perfect for relieving the stress of HR work.

## How to Play

1. **Resume Review Stage**
   - Review the candidate's resume
   - Choose to either:
     - 🎉 Hire the candidate (celebrates success!)

2. **Resume Crumpling Stage**
   - Click the resume 5 times to crumple it into a ball
   - Watch as the resume gets progressively more crumpled with each click
   - After 5 clicks, it transforms into a throwable ball

3. **Basketball Stage**
   - Adjust the angle (0-90 degrees) and power (0-100%) of your throw
   - Click "Throw!" to launch the paper ball
   - Try to get the ball into the basket
